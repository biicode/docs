Global commands
================

This section summarizes the general **commands available to be used with the biicode client program**. The biicode client is the main utility that allows you to:

* **manage** your project and blocks locally, on your computer,
* determine their internal and external **dependencies**,
* **retrieve** any missing code dependencies from the biicode servers,
* **publish** your code, and
* **reuse** other users' code.

All these functionalities are achieved using appropriate commands that are explained and used in many examples along this documentation, and are compiled here in a list for your convenience and reference.
