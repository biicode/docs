Web access
==========

One of the most important things is **how can I see my blocks or any user blocks?** You don´t really need to sign in biicode to see it. It´s so fast an easy, you only have to enter the URL:

	``www.biicode.com/user_name``
	
And you'll be able to see all the blocks published and profile about this user.

For example, try the `sbaker user <https://www.biicode.com/sbaker>`_
