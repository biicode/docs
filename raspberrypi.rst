Raspberry Pi Cross Compilation
==============================

`Raspberry Pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_ (RPi) is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and keyboard. It is a capable little computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC or laptop does, like games, spreadsheets, or word-processing. It also plays high-definition video.

Using biicode, you'll benefit from several advantages for your Raspberry Pi experience:

	1. Easy **Cross-compiling**, including support for OpenGL ES apps. 
	2. **Reuse yours and other users' code**. Code reusing is made easy; you only need to ``#include`` the file you need. Biicode automatically downloads all missing code, and builds your projects.
	3. Biicode also provides **a simple way to send information and communicate via SSH** with your board.
	4. You can also install biicode in the raspberry if you want to.

In this part of the documentation you will find resources and tutorials for installing all necessary tools, create your first Raspberry Pi C++ project, examples, and technology reference.
