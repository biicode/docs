Run your node programs

You can run your scripts as usual. However, biicode has a script to execute node.js programs, just execute ``noderunner <username/block_name>/<script_name>`` inside the ``blocks`` folder:

.. code-block:: bash

	 ~/PROJECT_DIR$ cd blocks
	 ~/PROJECT_DIR/blocks$ noderunner <username/block_name>/<script_name>
