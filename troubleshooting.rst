The biicode client stopped working
----------------------------------

As biicode is a rapidly evolving technology —right now we are releasing new versions of the product at least weekly—, you may find that suddenly some features have stopped working as expected. This can be due to some update in the logic of our servers or in the client program we provide. **If you are experiencing any difficulties with your local installation of biicode**, try to follow theses steps:

#. Update your biicode client :ref:`downloading the latest available release <installation>`.
#. From your workspace folder, execute the command ``bii clean``.
#. Finally, execute the command ``bii clean --ws-cache``.

After these simple actions, everything should be back to normal.
