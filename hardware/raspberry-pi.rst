Raspberry Pi
============  

The `Raspberry Pi <http://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_ is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It is a capable little computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays high-definition video.


**Why biicode?**

Biicode gives you several advantages for your Raspberry Pi experience. 

	1. **Auto cross compiling, including OpenGL ES apps**. 
	2. **Reuse yours and other users´ code**. Reuse make easy, just #include the file you need and you get it. No more copy and paste files from project to project.
	3. **An easy way to send information and communicate by SSH**

You can use biicode directly in it but we suggest setting using the cross compilation feature built in biicode.
Cross compilation only works in Linux at the moment so you can set up a virtual Linux machine or use the native rpi client.
