Arduino
=======

Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.


Why biicode?
============

Biicode gives you several advantages for your Arduino experience. 

	1. The opportunity to divide your Arduino project, i.e., you can save a same project in different folders if you want a better organization. 
	2. You can reuse other users´ code. You could use an interesting PID code, or an innovative controller which you would want to add in your project.
	3. You have a very simple and fast way to compile and upload your code in your Arduino.
